Conway’s Law is an IT theory created by computer scientist/programmer Melvin Conway in 1967. Conway’s Law states that:
> Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

The theory gained popularity when it was cited by Fred Brooks in the iconic book "The Mythical Man Month."

Conway’s Law was very much on Seb Chan’s mind when he was hired as the first chief experience officer (CXO) at ACMI, the Australian Centre for the Moving Images, in 2015. Chan’s role – newly created when he left the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum in New York – was pitched to him by the Director and CEO Katrina Sedgwick like this: 
> We want to transform the institution with technology and UX

That meant reforming ACMI so it could move fast – as fast as the internet. The problem is that museums, like many other large institutions, tend to approach change at a pace of every couple of years. 

## The reinvention of the org chart at ACMI
In 2019, when ACMI shut its doors to the public to undertake the building redevelopment process, another significant event took place, as well: with the guidance and encouragement of the director & CEO, employees voted in favor of a bottom-up staff restructure. 

The benefit was obvious. 
>The staff redesigned the organizational chart based on what they felt the new institution would need

says Chan. 

Conway’s Law posits that smaller teams can be more cohesive and produce better results, more quickly. ACMI’s restructure led to a smaller senior executive team, broken down into three major divisions: experience and engagement, curatorial and exhibition programming, and commercial and operations. Together, they made cross-functional collaboration the norm. 

The change also brought brand and marketing, collections and preservation, experience product and digital, IT &  business systems, infrastructure, and front of house visitor experience staff under Chan’s remit.
